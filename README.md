# CS50-Trivia

This project simulates the "quiz show" at the end of the last class of CS50's 2020 course.

It will be a command-line game where the user is asked successive questions and loses xp if the answer is wrong. When xp is zero, the player loses.
There are, however, ways for a player to get his xp back. By answering 5 questions correctly in a row, the player will receive 33 xp back.
The player will start with 100 xp, and 33 xp will be lost if a question is answered incorrectly.
